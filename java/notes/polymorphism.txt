polymorphism is the property of one thing(mostly function) to behave differently on input (same thing different reaction)

polymorphism can be of 2 type
1 compile time- which fuction will be executed is decided on the compile time 
example - function overloading
2 runtime - which function will be ezecuted is decided on the runtime
exmple- function overriding 

we can create a refrence of parent class which can be used to store any of its child class object 
in given example show method print the name of class
A obj=new A(); // now the obj is pointing to a object of A and it will print A (sow method of class A)
obj.show();
obj=new B();// now the obj is pointing to a object of B and it will print B (sow method of class B)
obj.show();
obj=new C();// now the obj is pointing to a object of C and it will print C (sow method of class C)
obj.show();

here in same object is used to call the same method which do different function hence its polymorphism and which function 
will be executed is decided on runtime hence runtime polymorphism
