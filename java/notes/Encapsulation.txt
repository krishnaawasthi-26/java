there is some thing which we can share like myName etc and some things are which we cant share like password etc

It is a concept that bundles (or "capsulates") data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class

access modifiers in java : **`protected`** and **default (package-private)**. These access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and constructors) from other classes. Here's an overview of all four access modifiers in Java:

1. **Private (`private`)**:
   - **Visibility**: The member is only accessible within the same class.
   - **Use Case**: It's used when you want to restrict access to a class's internal data and behavior completely from the outside world.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class MyClass {
         private int number; // Only accessible within MyClass
     }
     ```

### 2. **Public (`public`)**:
   - **Visibility**: The member is accessible from any other class, in any package.
   - **Use Case**: It's used when you want a class, field, or method to be universally accessible.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class MyClass {
         public int number; // Accessible from any other class
     }
     ```

### 3. **Protected (`protected`)**:
   - **Visibility**: The member is accessible within its own package and by subclasses (even if the subclass is in a different package).
   - **Use Case**: It's often used when you want to allow access to certain members from subclasses but not from other unrelated classes.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class MyClass {
         protected int number; // Accessible within same package and by subclasses
     }
     ```

### 4. **Default (Package-Private)**:
   - **Visibility**: If no access modifier is specified, the member is accessible only within its own package. This is known as **package-private**.
   - **Use Case**: It's used when you want to limit access to members within the same package, but not expose them to the outside world or subclasses.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     class MyClass {
         int number; // Accessible only within the same package (default)
     }
     ```

### Summary of Access Modifiers:
| Access Modifier | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Different Package) | Other Package |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| `private`       | Yes        | No           | No                           | No            |
| `default`       | Yes        | Yes          | No                           | No            |
| `protected`     | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                          | No            |
| `public`        | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                          | Yes           |

### Example Code:

```java
class Animal {
    private String name;      // Accessible only within the Animal class
    public int age;           // Accessible from anywhere
    protected String species; // Accessible within the package and by subclasses
    String habitat;           // Default (package-private), accessible within the package

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name, int age, String species, String habitat) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.species = species;
        this.habitat = habitat;
    }

    // Methods
    public void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Species: " + species + ", Habitat: " + habitat);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name, int age, String species, String habitat) {
        super(name, age, species, habitat);
    }

    public void display() {
        // System.out.println(name); // Error: 'name' is private in Animal
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);          // Accessible because 'age' is public
        System.out.println("Species: " + species);  // Accessible because 'species' is protected
        System.out.println("Habitat: " + habitat);  // Accessible because it's default (package-private)
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal("Lion", 10, "Panthera leo", "Savannah");
        animal.printDetails();
        
        Dog dog = new Dog("Bulldog", 5, "Canis lupus familiaris", "Urban");
        dog.display();
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Private** members cannot be accessed outside the class they are declared in.
- **Public** members can be accessed from anywhere.
- **Protected** members can be accessed within the same package or by subclasses, even if they are in different packages.
- **Package-private** (default, with no modifier) members can be accessed only within the same package.

This set of access levels helps control the visibility of your class components and ensures that you can protect and encapsulate data as needed in your Java programs.
