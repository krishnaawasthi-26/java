name size of different type of variable their size and 
how to explicitely mention to make some variable like for float its f and their ranges
  type of data type 
data type is a type of stroage which can we use to store different type of data like name age etc

Primitive Data Types - data type which are already already 
byte
Size: 1 byte
Range: -128 to 127
Example: byte a = 100;

short
Size: 2 bytes
Range: -32,768 to 32,767
Example: short b = 32000'

int
Size: 4 bytes
Range: -2^31 to 2^31-1
Example: int c = 100000;

long
Size: 8 bytes
Range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
Example: long d = 100000L;

float
Size: 4 bytes
Range: 1.4E-45 to 3.4E+38
Example: float e = 3.14f;

double
Size: 8 bytes
Range: 4.9E-324 to 1.8E+308
Example: double f = 3.14159265359;

char
Size: 2 bytes
Range: 0 to 65,535 (representing Unicode characters)
Example: char g = 'A';

boolean
Size: 1 bit (but JVM implementation may vary)
Values: true or false
Example: boolean h = true;

2. Reference (Non-Primitive) Data Types
These data types are more complex and refer to objects. Reference data types can store references (or addresses) to objects in memory.

String: A sequence of characters (objects in Java, but behaves like a primitive in many ways).
Example: String name = "Java";

Arrays: An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
Example: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};

Class: A user-defined type that is used to create objects.
Example: class Car { String model; int year; }

Interface: A reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
Example: interface Shape { void draw(); }

Enum: A special Java type used to define collections of constants.

Example: enum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY }
