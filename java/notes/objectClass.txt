in java every class inherit the object class and in object class we have some default functions like toString and so on 

if we try to print the object we will the output as objectName.toString() which will give us className@andSomeHexadecimalValues
the hexadecimal number is actuall the hashCode in hexdecimal format

but if we implement toString method which return some string when we try to print it we return what our toString function
