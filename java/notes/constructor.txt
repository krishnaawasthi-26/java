write what is constructor and what it is used for also write why we need constructor what is its need and what will happen if it doesnt exist 
also about paramirtized one and constructor overloading 

also about super that when we use inheritance and we make a object of child class it will call the constructor of both parent and child class
respectively 

note every class in java extend the Object class hence parent class also have super but if that class make a child class it will only extend 
the parent class and it extend object class hence its a multilevel inheritance.

this() - class the default constructor of a class
