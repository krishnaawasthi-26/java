in memory the data can be stored in 2 type

1 in stack where there is 2 coloumn first if name and second is value of that variable

2 in heap which is expandable memory is allocated using new operator

note - variable which are inside a class are allocated in heap(dynamiclly)


when we create a object a space in stack is allocated to that oject on one side there is name of object and on other side there is a address which point to a memory block in heap which contain all the variable of that obejct including the function defination but if the function is called its storage is stored stack
