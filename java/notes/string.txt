string can store n number of character like a line or a sentence etc
in java string is a non primitive data type,hence we have a class name String in our java file 

we can use string like normal like we do with the int and other primitive data type
String s="hello"; this is same as 2 one can use anyone but if you use this compiler will make it 2 at the end
this work but this is not the correct way to declear a string to declear a string properly we need to declear 
it like we declear a object of any class (className objectName =new className();)
String s=new String(); to store data we can 2 things 
1 declear in one line and then iniciate in next line
2 give the value of the string in the () after className example String s=new String("hello");

to get hashCode of a string we can just do stringName.hashCode(); and we can put it in a variable or print it

inside class String we have many methods which we can use to do some operation the string like:

------------------------------------------------------------state some improtant string method----------------------

every string in java is a constant that means that it is inmutable thta means we cant change the value of string 

but is you try to change the value of any string it will change without any error but then how its inmutable 

in heap (where all dynamic allocate memory is like string) there is a part called string constant pool here all the strings are stored 
but note is 2 string have same value then the references will have same address heance if we create 2 string with same content 
the address where value is stored will be same

hence if we change content of any string then the address will also change

but what if we want muttable string java have another 2 class for mutable string 

1 string buffer-

2 string builder-

string buffer have a capacity which canbe seen by doing s.capacity(); s is name of string
and this will be 16 + length of the string(but what if we decrease character afterwarts)

we have many methods like 
_____________________________________give some methods------------------------------------





difference is one is thread safe and another is not
