identifier is a thing which canbe used for identification purposes 
like name -shiva ,nasir ,garvit and etc
hence identifier is name can be variable name ,method name ,class name ,lebel name etc
exammple- 
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] argv){
  int a=10;
  }
}
there is in total 5 identifier
Main
main
String
argv
a


rules to name a identifier
Note dont get confused if you see variable at place of identifier same rules are for both
1. Basic Rules for Naming identifier:
Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($):

The first character cannot be a number.
Example: myVariable, _myVariable, $myVariable are valid, but 1stVariable is invalid.
Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs:

After the first character, you can use digits (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), underscores (_), or dollar signs ($).
Example: myVariable123, _variableName, $var are valid, but var@name is invalid.
Variable names are case-sensitive:

myVariable and myvariable are treated as different variables.
Example: int count = 10; and int Count = 20; are valid but represent two different variables.
Variable names cannot be Java reserved keywords:

Keywords like int, class, public, if, else, try, etc., cannot be used as variable names.
Example: int class = 10; is invalid because class is a reserved keyword in Java.
Variable names must be meaningful and descriptive:

It's important to give your variables descriptive names so that anyone reading your code can understand its purpose.
For example: age, studentName, totalAmount are much more meaningful than just a, b, c.


note there is no limit in length of a identifier we can't use reserved  words like if ,but we can use name as predefined classis like String
etc

Rule	                                     Description
Start with a letter, _ or $	The first character must be a letter, _, or $.
Subsequent characters	Can include letters, digits, _, or $.
Case-sensitive	Java is case-sensitive. myVar and myvar are different.
No reserved keywords	Can't use Java keywords (e.g., class, public).
Meaningful names	Choose descriptive names like totalAmount or ageOfStudent.
CamelCase	Follow camelCase convention for variable names.
