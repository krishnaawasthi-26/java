In Java, an anonymous object is an object that is created and used without assigning it to a reference variable. Essentially, it is an object that doesn't have a name (or reference) and is typically used for one-time usage. 

Anonymous objects are commonly used when you don't need to reuse the object and you only need it for a short duration, like passing it as a parameter to a method, or invoking a method on it without needing to reference it later.

 Characteristics of Anonymous Objects:
1. No Reference Variable: The object is not assigned to a reference variable.
2. Typically Used Once: It's created and used in one place, usually for a single method call or a one-time operation.
3. Short-Live: It exists only for the scope of the expression where it's created.

Example of Using Anonymous Objects:

java
class Car {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("The car has stopped.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating and using an anonymous object for a one-time action
        new Car().drive();  // Anonymous object created and used to call 'drive()'

        // Another anonymous object used for a different method call
        new Car().stop();   // Anonymous object created and used to call 'stop()'
    }
}

 Explanation:
In the code above:
- new Car().drive(); creates an anonymous object of type `Car` and immediately calls the `drive()` method on it.
- new Car().stop(); creates another anonymous object of type `Car` and immediately calls the `stop()` method.

These anonymous objects are used for one-time method invocations, and you don’t need to keep a reference to them after the method call. 

Why Use Anonymous Objects?
1. Simplicity: They are helpful when you need to create a temporary object to call a method but don't need to store it in a variable.
2. Memory Efficiency: Since they are not stored in a variable, they can be garbage collected right after the method invocation, especially if they are used only once.

Another Example: Passing Anonymous Objects to Methods

java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

public class Main {
    // Method that accepts an Animal object
    static void performAction(Animal animal) {
        animal.makeSound();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Passing an anonymous object directly to the method
        performAction(new Animal());  // Anonymous object passed to performAction
    }
}

In this case, `new Animal()` creates an anonymous object, which is immediately passed to the `performAction` method.

Common Use Cases of Anonymous Objects:
1. Event Handlers: For example, in GUI programming (e.g., with Swing), anonymous objects are often used to handle events:
   button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           System.out.println("Button clicked!");
       }
   });

   Here, the `ActionListener` is anonymous and is created only to handle the button click event.
   
2. Method Arguments: When you want to pass an object to a method but don’t need to reference it afterward.

Limitations:
- No Reference: You can’t refer to the object after its use, so you can’t reuse or modify it once it’s created.
- Less Readable for Complex Logic: If the logic inside the anonymous object is complex, it can make the code harder to read and maintain. In those cases, creating a named class or using a lambda expression (for functional interfaces) might be a better approach.

In summary, anonymous objects are convenient for temporary object creation when you don’t need to retain a reference to the object after it's used.
