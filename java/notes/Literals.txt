a literal is a fixed value that is directly written into the code. These values represent constant data of a specific type, such as numbers, characters, or boolean values. Literals are used to assign values to variables, pass data to functions, or directly appear in expressions.

1. Integer Literals
Base: Integer literals can be in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary format.
Suffix:
L or l: Used for long literals (e.g., 123L).
Integer literals without any suffix are treated as int by default.
Rules:
Decimal Integer: Just write the number without any prefix (e.g., 123, -456).
Hexadecimal Integer: Prefix the number with 0x or 0X (e.g., 0xA1, 0XFF).
Octal Integer: Prefix the number with 0 (e.g., 075).
Binary Integer: Prefix the number with 0b or 0B (e.g., 0b1010, 0B1100).

2. Floating-Point Literals
Default: Floating-point literals are considered double by default.
Suffix:
f or F: Used to specify a float literal.
Rules:
Floating-point (double): Decimal numbers without a suffix (e.g., 3.14, -5.6).
Floating-point (float): Add f or F to indicate a float (e.g., 3.14f, -5.6f).
Scientific Notation: Use e or E to represent numbers in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e3, 3.14E-2).

3. Character Literals
Enclosed in single quotes: A character literal must be a single character enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'A', '1', '%').
Escape Sequences: Special characters like newline (\n), tab (\t), backslash (\\), etc., can be represented using escape sequences.
Rules:
Single character: Write any character inside single quotes (e.g., 'A', 'Z').
Escape sequences: Use backslash (\) followed by a character for special characters (e.g., '\n', '\t', '\\').

4. String Literals
Enclosed in double quotes: A string literal must be a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello", "123", "Java").
Escape Sequences: Special characters like newline, tab, quotes, and backslashes inside strings can be represented using escape sequences (e.g., "\n", "\"").
Rules:
String: Write the sequence of characters inside double quotes (e.g., "Hello World", "123").
Escape sequences: Use backslash (\) followed by a special character (e.g., "Hello\nWorld", "\"Quotes\"").

5. Boolean Literals
Values: Boolean literals can only be true or false.
Rules:
Boolean literals: Directly use true or false

6. Null Literal
Value: The null literal represents the absence of an object reference.
Rules:
null: It is written as null (all lowercase).
